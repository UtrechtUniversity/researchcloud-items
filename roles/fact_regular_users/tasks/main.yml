# sets variable {{fact_regular_users}} to a list of users 
# example content with just one user named "foo": 
# [   { user: "foo", 
#       userid: 1000, groupid: 1000, 
#       home: "/home/foo", 
#       shell: "/bin/bash",
#       description: "sample user foo"
#     }  
# ]
# 
# assumes a Unix-like environment where all users are listed in /etc/passwd
# selects users that meet the following criteria
#   - userid > 999  which excludes system roles
#   - home directory underneath /home
#
# NB ugly hack: the filter set "to_json|from_json" is needed to transform a dictionary
#     with unicode strings to a dictionary with ascii strings
#     as json_query expects ascii strings

# jmespath is required for filter 
- name: ensure jmespath is installed
  pip:
    name: jmespath

- name: read database /etc/passwd
  getent:
    database: passwd

- name: set fact regular_users
  set_fact:
    fact_regular_users: "{{ getent_passwd|dict2items|to_json|from_json|
    json_query('[?to_number(value[1]) >`999` && starts_with(value[4], `/home/`) 
    ].{user: key, userid: to_number(value[1]), groupid: to_number(value[2]), 
    description: value[3], home: value[4], shell: value[5]}') }}"
