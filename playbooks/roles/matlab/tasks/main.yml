# depends: Ubuntu + desktop GUI

# Matlab installation requires you to have prepared 2 files:
#  1) target machine must locally have a file with Matlab software ISO image 
#    NB: You should obtain this ISO image from MathWorks Inc.
#
#  2) target machine must locally have a file with configuration information
#    NB: file format should be yaml, suggested variables are:
#     matlab_file_installation_key
#     matlab_license_text
#     matlab_products  (specify here if not all products are to be installed)
#
# As an alternative approach to 2) one could provide the variables as part of an Ansible playbook
#
