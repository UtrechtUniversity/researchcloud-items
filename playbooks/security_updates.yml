# Unattended security updates are enabled by default on Ubuntu.
# However, on cloud VMs, this feature can cause issues with a dpkg lock conflict during provisioning:
# It is therefore currently disabled on SURF Research Cloud.
# This Playbook runs the security updates, avoiding the lock conflict (as ansible will wait until the upgrade is done).
# It then enables periodic, unattended security updates.
