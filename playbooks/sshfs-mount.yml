# when calling this Ansible script, the following variables MUST be set:
#   sshfs_server    - ip address of server that shares filesystem
#
# Recommended:  
# - set mode of "/home/{{ robot_user_name }}/shared-data" recursively
#   read+execute for the robot user and owned by some other user e.g. root. 
#   This ensures that other workspaces cannot overwrite or erase server data
