# This scenario tests the role with the 'miniconda_systemwide' parameter set to false.
# Since we cannot currently have multiple scenarios for a playbook, system-wide installation is tested by the scenario 'role-miniconda'.
# To have multiple scenarios for a playbook in CI, we should first move to a one-repo per component setup.
