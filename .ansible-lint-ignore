# Using this file instead of "skip_list" in .ansible-lint is recommended, as "skip_list" will completely suppress all warnings.
# By contrast, exceptions listed in this file will be printed in the linter output as "ignored".

# Ignore rules in specific files as follows:
# playbooks/transferuser.yml yaml[empty-lines]

molecule/playbook-aptly/molecule.yml yaml[line-length] # molecule test parameters are long
molecule/playbook-reverse_proxy/molecule.yml yaml[line-length] # molecule test parameters are long
molecule/playbook-reverse_proxy/verify.yml yaml[line-length] # URL expectations are too long
playbooks/roles/sshfs_mount/main/tasks.yml yaml[line-length] # fstab options are too long
playbooks/roles/camunda_server/tasks/main.yml yaml[line-length]
