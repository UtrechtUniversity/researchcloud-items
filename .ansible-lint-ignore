# Using this file instead of "skip_list" in .ansible-lint is recommended, as "skip_list" will completely suppress all warnings.
# By contrast, exceptions listed in this file will be printed in the linter output as "ignored".

# Ignore rules in specific files as follows:
# playbooks/transferuser.yml yaml[empty-lines]

playbooks/roles/transferuser/molecule/default/verify.yml risky-shell-pipe
playbooks/roles/stata18/molecule/default/prepare.yml command-instead-of-module
playbooks/roles/stata18/molecule/default/prepare.yml inline-env-var # this is a bug in some versions of ansible-lint

molecule/playbook-aptly/molecule.yml yaml[line-length] # molecule test parameters are long
molecule/playbook-reverse_proxy/molecule.yml yaml[line-length] # molecule test parameters are long
