# Default Molecule .env.yml file
# To make molecule use this file, place it in the root of your project (or from whichever directory you are calling 'molecule').
# NOTE: paths are relative to the location of the main molecule.yml file.
# Thus, if you run molecule with 'molecule -c ./ext/molecule/molecule.yml'...
# ...you should set PLAYBOOK_DIR to '../../../' (descend three subdirectories) to set it to your working directory.
# Alternatively, you may also set absolute paths.
