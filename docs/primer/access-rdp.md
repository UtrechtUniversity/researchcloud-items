# Access workspace using Remote Desktop Protocol
[back to index](../primer-for-users.md)

### Preparation
Ensure that your laptop/workstation supports Remote Desktop connections:

- Windows 10+: Support for Remote Desktop may be installed already.
  Find the program in the windows desktop menu, or open a commandline prompt and type ***mstsc*** 
  to start the remote desktop client program.  
  
  Alternatively, in the search box on the taskbar, type ***Remote Desktop Connection***.   
  In case this does not yield any results, you will need to upgrade your Windows Edition
  or install Remote Desktop as additional software.

- Linux: Install a Remote Desktop viewer, for example ["Remmina"](https://remmina.org/).

Access to the workspace requires that you register a time-based one-time password (TOTP). 
See the SURF wiki for instructions to [configure a time-based password](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Log+in+to+your+workspace).   

### Accessing a running workspace

Login to [SURF ResearchCloud portal](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl).

The Dashboard page shows the workspaces that you have access to. Unfold the
workspace to find its ***IP address*** (requires state = running).

Now you are ready to connect to the workspace using your favorite Remote Desktop Connection 
application.
Use the ***Username*** listed in the ResearchCloud portal on the Profile page 
as your workspace username. Use a time-based ***code*** as your password.
