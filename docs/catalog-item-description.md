# How to describe catalog items
(bach to [developer documentation](index.md))   

We aim to harmonize the content in the description field  of SURF Research Cloud catalog items
so that end-users and/or developers can make well-informed decisions when
they select an item for their use case.

## Catalog item target audience 
Plugin descriptions should target developers and integrators that prepare workspace configurations.

Descriptions of an Application or Application Offer should target end-users. 
Currently, Application descriptions are displayed in the catalog whenever users select 
a workspace type for deployment.

## Description for all catalog item types
Add the following structured information to the description of a catalog item
and choose from the applicable list of values:

| Tag:        | Content options: |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Status      | "Experimental, use with caution" |
|             | "Supported" |
| Suitability | "non-sensitive data only" |
|             | "sensitive data" |


## Description for Application / Application Offer catalog item types
In addition to the above structured information, add the following:

| Tag:        | Content options: |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Maintenance | "Automated (security) patches configured" |
|             | "User must manually apply (security) patches" |
