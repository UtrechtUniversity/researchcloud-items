# How to describe catalog items
(bach to [developer documentation](index.md))   

We aim to harmonize the content in the description field  of SURF Research Cloud catalog items
so that end-users and/or developers can make well-informed decisions when
they select an item for their use case.

## Catalog item target audience 
We will work under the assumption that Plugin descriptions are used by
IT professionals (developers, integrators) that prepare workspace configurations.

Descriptions of an Application or Application Offer should target end-users. 
Currently, Application descriptions are displayed in the catalog whenever users select 
a workspace type for deployment.

## Description for all catalog item types
Add the following structured information to the description of a catalog item
and choose from the applicable list of values:

| Status | "Supported" |
|        | "Experimental, use with caution" |
| Suitability | "non-sensitive data only" |
|             | "sensitive data" |


## Description for Application / Application Offer catalog item types
In addition to the above structured information, add the following:

| Maintenance | "Automated (security) patches configured" |
| Maintenance | "User must manually apply (security) patches" |
