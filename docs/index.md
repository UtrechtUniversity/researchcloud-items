# Developer documentation
This is the developer documentation for this repository.
See this [primer SURF ResearchCloud](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/research-cloud-intro.html) for end-user documentation.

Below is a section for [playbooks](#Playbooks) and a section for [roles](#Roles) (reusable items that can be included in a playbook).
The playbook and roles can be used stand-alone (run them locally on the target host), but are
designed with the goal of deploying them in the deployment of a ResearchCloud workspace.

Contributed playbooks and roles should meet criteria specified in our [item quality checklist](./item_quality_checklist.md).

## External component repositories

This repository contains the bulk of UU's ResearchCloud components for Unix/Linux workspaces, which are based on Ansible playbooks, and it also provides reusable roles as a [collection](#installing-as-a-collection). This documentation is exclusively for the playbooks and roles contained in this repo.

However, some components are not part of this repository and can be found elsewhere. This can be for several reasons (see below). Below is a list of important UU-maintained ResearchCloud components outside of this repository. Documentation should be contained in these external repositories.

Components for specific research projects (not intended for general use) should preferably also be stored in a separate repository. They can use the roles in this repo by [installing it as a collection](#installing-as-a-collection).

## Installing as a collection

The roles and playbooks in this repository can also be installed as an Ansible collection. The collection is named `uusrc.general`. After installation, this means you can use the roles from this repository, for example as follows:

```yaml
roles:
    - role: uusrc.general.fact_regular_users
```

To install the collection you have two options:

* install manually with `ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/utrechtuniversity/researchcloud-items.git`
* add this repository to your `requirements.yml`:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/researchcloud-items.git
    type: git
```
